# spelunky-godot
Remaking spelunky in godot to practice. I'm recreating the art, sound and music myself. It's not going to have all of the features of the original game. Considet it an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of spelunky.

You can see the entire cave all att once. Or alternatively you can see a low further than in the original spelunky.
