# spelunky-godot
Remaking spelunky in godot to practice. I'm recreating the art, sound and music myself. It's not going to have all of the features of the original game. Considet it an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of spelunky.

# Creative Liberties
You can see the entire cave all att once. Or alternatively you can see a low further than in the original spelunky.

Here's my inspiration for the art. I have not been able to find out what person made this game or what the game is called. Here's the screenshot:

It's clean, and makes my life so much easier than trying to make it look like the real game.
